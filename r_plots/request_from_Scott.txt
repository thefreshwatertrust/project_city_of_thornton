Katie, is there someone at TFT who can create 5 bell curves and one box and whisker plot series for me using this data?  This is for the Thornton project.  The attached spreadsheet is a list of property sales (land only values—no water) on the Water Supply and Storage Company (WSSC) system—broken down by return flow sector (RF).  I need a bell curve (or a skewed distribution curve if more appropriate) for the sales in each RF sector.  The graphs should be labeled: Return Flow Sector 1, Return Flow Sector 2, etc.  Vertical axis would be the number of sales, horizontal the price per acre.  I would like the median value labeled on each graph…and perhaps the upper and lower standard deviation limits.  For the box and whisker series, I would like to compare box and whisker plots for all five RF sectors.  Vertical axis is price.  Horizontal axis is RF sector.

These are getting put into a TFT technical report, so the typical TFT source sans font/color scheme is needed.
